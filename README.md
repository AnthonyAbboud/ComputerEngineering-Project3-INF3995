# ComputerEngineering-Project3-INF3995
3rd year project of my Computer Engineering Bachelor

This project contains a Python server and an Android application. The goal of this project was to receive real time data from a flying rocket, and send them from the server to the clients, who will then be able to manipulate and display the data on their devices for different widgets.
